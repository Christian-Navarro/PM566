# Discussion for Week [#] assignment

Welcome to week #! We will be using this issue tracker for this week's sessions. 

- Lecture slides can be downloaded [here]() (source code [here]())
- Lab materials can be found [here]() (source code [here]())

Once you have completed your lab, please either:

a. Upload your pdf/html file with your solutions here ([more info](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests)),
b. Add a link to a Github repository where you keep the file using [Github's auto-links](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls), or
c. Send Prof. Franklin an email with your work for the lab.

## Assignment

1. The file for this week's assignment can be downloaded from [here](#). The specific
   instructions for the assignment will be included in the zip file (follow the instructions
   [here](github.com/USCbiostats/PM566/raw/master/assignments-instructions.md)).

2. Once you are done with the assignment, we encourage you to either add the URL to this issue in your last commit message or create a new issue in your repository including a link to this issue. If you are not comfortable with either, send your files to Prof. Franklin.

3. We will provide feedback directly to your repository (or by email, if you chose so).
