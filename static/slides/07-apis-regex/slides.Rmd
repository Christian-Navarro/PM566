## Today's goals

- Introduction to Regular Expressions

- Understand the fundamentals of Web Scrapping

- Learn how to use an API

---

## Regular Expressions: What is it?

> A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png" width="450px">

---

## Regular Expressions: Why should you care?

We can use Regular Expressions for:

- Validating data fields, email address, numbers, etc.

- Searching text in various formats, e.g., addresses, there are many ways to write an address.

- Replace text, e.g., different spellings, `Storm`, `Stôrm`, `Stórm` to `Storm`.

- Remove text, e.g., tags from an HTML text, `<name>George</name>` to `George`.

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Metacharacters

What makes *regex* special is metacharacters. While we can always use *regex* to match literals like `dog`, `human`, `1999`, we only make use of all *regex* power when using metacharacters:

- `.` Any character except new line
- `^` beginning of the text
- `$` end of the text
- `[regex]` Match a single character in `regex`, e.g.

    - `[0123456789]` Any number
    - `[0-9]` Any number in the range 0-9
    - `[a-z]` Lower-case letters
    - `[A-Z]` Upper-case letters
    - `[a-zA-Z]` Lower or upper case letters.
    - `[a-zA-Z0-9]` Any alpha-numeric

- `[^regex]` Match any except those in `regex`, e.g.

    - `[^0123456789]` Match any except a number
    - `[^0-9]` Match anything except in the range 0-9
    - `[^./ ]` any except dot, slash, and space.

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Metacharacters (cont. 1)

Ranges, e.g., `0-9` or `a-z`, are locale- and implementation-dependent, meaning that the range of lower case letters may vary depending on the OS's language. To solve for this problem, you could use [Character classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Character_classes). Some examples:

- `[:lower:]` lower case letters in the current locale, could be `[a-z]`
- `[:upper:]` upper case letters in the current locale, could be `[A-Z]`
- `[:alpha:]` upper and lower case letters in the current locale, could be `[a-zA-Z]`
- `[:digit:]` Digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- `[:alnum:]` Alpha numeric characters `[:alpha:]` and `[:digit:]`.
- `[:punct:]` Punctuation characters: ! " \# $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \\ ] ^ _ &#96; \{ | \} ~.

For example, in the locale `en_US`, the word `Ḧóla` IS NOT fully matched by `[a-zA-Z]+`, but IT IS fully matched by `[[:alpha:]]+`.

Other important Metacharacters:

- `\s` white space, equivalent to `[\r\n\t\f\v ]`
- `|` or (logical or).

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Metacharacters (cont. 2)

These usually come together with specifying how many times (repetition):

- `regex?` Zero or one match.
- `regex*` Zero or more matches
- `regex+` One or more matches
- `regex{n,}` At least `n` matches
- `regex{,m}` at most `m` matches
- `regex{n,m}` Between `n` and `m` matches.

Where `regex` is a regular expression

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Metacharacters (cont. 3)

There are other operators that can be very useful,

- `(regex)` Group capture.
- `(?:regex)` Group operation without capture.
- `(?=regex)` Look ahead (match)
- `(?!regex)` Look ahead (don't match)
- `(?<=regex)` Look behind (match)
- `(?<!regex)` Look behind (don't match)

Group captures can be reused with `\1`, `\2`, ..., `\n`.

More (great) information here https://regex101.com/

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Examples 

Here we are extracting the first occurrence of the following regular expressions
(using `stringr::str_extract()`):

```{r regex-examples-extract, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(stringr)
txt <- c("Hanna Perez [name]", "The 年 year was 1999", "HaHa, @abc said that", "GoGo trojans #2020!")
regex <- c(
  ".{5}",
  "n{2}",
  "[0-9]+",
  "\\s[a-zA-Z]+\\s",
  "\\s[[:alpha:]]+\\s",
  "[a-zA-Z]+ [a-zA-Z]+", 
  "([a-zA-Z]+\\s?){2}",
  "([a-zA-Z]+)\\1",
  "(@|#)[a-z0-9]+",
  "(?<=#|@)[a-z0-9]+",
  "\\[[a-z]+\\]"
  )
ans <- lapply(regex, stringr::str_extract, string = txt)
ans <- do.call(rbind, ans)
colnames(ans) <- txt
ans <- cbind(regex = regex, ans)
ans[is.na(ans)] <- ""
ans[nrow(ans),1] <- "&#92&#91&#91a-z&#93+&#92&#93"
knitr::kable(ans, format = "html", escape = FALSE)
```

---
## Regular Expressions 101: Examples (cont. 1)

1. `r regex[1]` Match **any character** (except line end) five times.

2. `r regex[2]` Match the letter **n** twice.

3. `r regex[3]` Match **any number** at least once

4. `r regex[4]` Match a **space**, **any lower or upper case letter** at least once, and a **space**. 

5. `r regex[5]` Same as before but this time . 

6. `r regex[6]` Match two sets of letters separated by one space.

7. `r regex[7]` Match **any lower or upper case letter** at least once, maybe followed by a white space, twice.

8. `r regex[8]` Match **any lower or upper case letter** at least once, and then match the same pattern again.

9. `r regex[9]` Match either the `@` or `#` symbol, followed by one or more **lower case letter** or **number**.

10. `r regex[10]` Match one or more **lower case letter** or **number** that follows either the `@` or `#` symbol.

11. \\ [[a-z]+\\ ] Match the symbol `[`, at least one **lower case letter**, and the symbol `]`.

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Functions in R

1. Lookup text: `base::grepl()`, `stringr::str_detect()`.

2. Similar to `which()`, which elements are `TRUE` `base::grep()`, `stringr::str_which()`

3. Replace the first instance: `base::sub()`, `stringr::str_replace()`

4. Replace all instances: `base::gsub()`, `stringr::str_replace_all()`

5. Extract text: `base::regmatches()`, `stringr::str_extract()` and `stringr::str_extract_all()`.

---

## Regular Expressions 101: Functions in R (cont.)

For example, like in Twitter, let's create a regex that matches usernames
or hashtags with the following pattern:

`(@|#)([[:alnum:]]+)`

```{r example-regex-2, echo = FALSE}
txt0 <- c("@Hanna Perez [name] #html", "The @年 year was 1999", "HaHa, @abc said that @z")
txt <- NULL
pattern <- "(@|#)([[:alnum:]]+)"
txt <- c(txt, str_detect(txt0, pattern))
txt <- c(txt, str_extract(txt0, pattern))
txt <- c(txt, paste0("[", sapply(str_extract_all(txt0, pattern), paste, collapse = ", "), "]"))
txt <- c(txt, str_replace(txt0, pattern, "\\1justinbieber"))
txt <- c(txt, str_replace_all(txt0, pattern, "\\1justinbieber"))

txt <- matrix(txt, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(txt) <- txt0
txt <- cbind(
  Code = c(
    "`str_detect(text, pattern)` or `grepl(pattern, text)`",
    "`str_extract(text, pattern)`",
    "`str_extract_all(text, pattern)`",
    "`str_replace(text, pattern, \"\\1justinbieber\")`",
    "`str_replace_all(text, pattern, \"\\1justinbieber\")`"
  ), txt
)

knitr::kable(txt)
```

**Note**: While it is not showing in the table, the group replacement was scaped, i.e., `\\1` instead of `\1` in the code.

---

## Data

This week we will continue using Textmining dataset (together with the `data.table` and `stringr` packages)

```{r load-data}
library(data.table)
library(stringr)

fn <- "mtsamples.csv"
if (!file.exists(fn))
  download.file(
    url = "https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/raw/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv",
    destfile = fn
  )
mtsamples <- fread(fn, sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```


---

## Regex Lookup Text: Tumor

We would like to see if this is tumor related entry. For that we can simply use
the following code:

```{r lookup-tumor}
# How many entries contain the word tumor
mtsamples[grepl("tumor", description, ignore.case = TRUE), .N] 

# Generating a column tagging tumor
mtsamples[, tumor_related := grepl("tumor", description, ignore.case = TRUE)]

# Taking a look at a few examples
mtsamples[tumor_related == TRUE, .(description)][1:3,]
```

Notice the `ignore.case = TRUE`. This is equivalent to transforming the text to lower case using `tolower()` before passing the text to the regular expression function.

---

## Regex Lookup text: Gender of the patient

Now, let's try to guess the gender of the patient. To do so, we could tag by
using the words *he, she, him, her, his, hers* (see [this article on sexist text](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/sexist-language?q=He%2C+she%2C+him%2C+her%2C+his%2C+hers)):

```{r}
mtsamples[, gender := str_extract(
  string  = tolower(transcription),
  pattern = "he|his|him|she|hers|her"
)]
```

What is the problem with this approach?

---

## Regex Lookup text: Gender of the patient (cont. 1)

For this we use the following regular expression:

`(?<=\W|^)(he|his|him|she|hers|her)(?=\W|$)`

Bit by bit this is:

- `(?<=regex)` lookback search.
    - `\W` any no alpha numeric character, this is equivalent to `[^[:alnum:]]`, `|` or
    - `^` the begging of text,
- `he|his|him...` any of these words,
- `(?=regex)` followed by,
    - `\W` any no alpha numeric character, this is equivalent to `[^[:alnum:]]`, `|` or
    - `$` the end of the text.

```{r gender-regex}
mtsamples[, gender := str_extract(
  string  = tolower(transcription), 
  pattern = "(?<=\\W|^)(he|his|him|she|hers|her)(?=\\W|$)"
  )]
mtsamples[1:10, gender]
```

---

## Regex Lookup text: Gender of the patient (cont. 2)

```{r gender-regex-cont}
mtsamples[, female := fifelse(gender %in% c("he", "his", "him"), FALSE, TRUE)]
mtsamples[, table(gender, female, useNA = "always")]
```


---

## Regex Extract Text: Type of Cancer

- Imagine now that you need to see the types of Cancer mentioned in the data.

- For simplicity, let's assume that, if specified, it is in the form of `TYPE cancer`, i.e. single word.

- We are interested in the word before cancer, how can we capture this?

---

## Regex Extract Text: Type of Cancer (cont 1.)

We can just try to **extract** the phrase `"[some word] cancer"`, in particular, we could use the
following regular expression

`[[:alnum:]-_]{4,}\s*cancer`

Where

- `[[:alnum:]-_]{4,}` captures any alphanumeric character, including `-` and `_`. 
   Furthermore, for this match to work there must be at least 4 characters,
- `\s*` captures 0 or more white-spaces, and
- `cancer` captures the word cancer:

```{r cancer-regex}
mtsamples[, cancer_type := str_extract(tolower(keywords), "[[:alnum:]-_]{4,}\\s*cancer")]
mtsamples[, table(cancer_type)]
```


---

## Fundamentals of Web Scrapping

**What?**

> Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)

**How?**

- The [`rvest`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rvest) R package provides various tools for reading and processing web data.

- Under-the-hood, `rvest` is a wrapper of the [`xml2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xml2)
and [`httr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr) R packages.

---

## Web scraping raw HTML: Example

We would like to capture the table of COVID-19 death rates per country directly from Wikipedia.

```{r setup-scrape}
library(rvest) # This loads the xml2 R package

# Reading the HTML table with the function xml2::read_html
covid <- read_html(
  x = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_death_rates_by_country"
  )

# Let's the the output
covid
```

---

## Web scraping raw HTML: Example (cont 1.)

- We want to get the HTML table that shows up in the doc To do such, we can use the
  function `xml2::xml_find_all()` and `rvest::html_table()`

- The first will locate the place in the document that matches a given **XPath**
  expression.
  
- [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath), XML Path Language, is a query language to select nodes in a XML
  document.
  
- A nice tutorial can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp)

- Modern Web browsers make it easy to use XPath!

Live Example! (inspect elements in [Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open),
[Mozilla Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector), [Internet Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/ie-mode), and [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/Web_Inspector_Tutorial/EditingCode/EditingCode.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017576-CH4-DontLinkElementID_25))
  
---

## Web scraping with `xml2` and the `rvest` package (cont. 2)

Now that we know what is the path, let's use that and extract

```{r get-table-covid}
table <- xml_find_all(covid, xpath = "/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[5]/div[1]/table[2]")
table <- html_table(table) # This returns a list of tables
head(table[[1]])
```

---

## Web APIs

**What?**

> A Web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API)

Some examples include: [twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en), [facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/), [Gene Ontology API](http://api.geneontology.org/api)

**How?**

You can request data, the **GET method**, post data, the **POST method**, and do many other things using the [HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).

**How in R?**

For this part, we will be using the `httr()` package, which is a wrapper of the
`curl()` package, which in turn provides access to the `curl` library that
is used to communicate with APIs.

---

## Web APIs with curl

<div align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/authors/jeremymcpeak/http1-url-structure.png" width="700px">
<br>
Structure of a URL (source: <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177" target="_blank">"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1"</a>)
</div>

---

## Web APIs with curl

Under-the-hood, the `httr` (and thus `curl`) sends request somewhat like this

```bash
curl -X GET https://google.com -w "%{content_type}\n%{http_code}\n"
```

A get request (`-X GET`) to `https://google.com`, which also includes (`-w`) the following:
`content_type` and `http_code`:

```html
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="https://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
text/html; charset=UTF-8
301
```

We use the `httr` R package to make life easier.

---

## Web API Example 1: Gene Ontology

- We will make use of the [Gene Ontology API](http://api.geneontology.org/api).

- We want to know what genes (human or not) are **involved in** the function **antiviral innate immune response** (go term [GO:0140374](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0140374)), looking only at those annotations that have evidence code [ECO:0000006](https://evidenceontology.org/browse/#ECO_0000006) (experimental evidence):

```{r example-gene-ontology, cache=TRUE}
library(httr)
go_query <- GET(
  url   = "http://api.geneontology.org/",
  path  = "api/bioentity/function/GO:0140374/genes",
  query = list(
    evidence          = "ECO:0000006",
    relationship_type = "involved_in"
  ),
  # May need to pass this option to curl to allow to wait for at least
  # 60 seconds before returning error.
  config = config(
    connecttimeout = 60
    )
)
```

We could have also passed the full URL directly...

---

## Web API Example 1: Gene Ontology (cont. 1)

Let's take a look at the curl call:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://api.geneontology.org/api/bioentity/function/GO:0140374/genes?evidence=ECO%3A0000006&relationship_type=involved_in" -H "accept: application/json"
```

What `httr::GET()` does:

```r
> go_query$request
## <request>
## GET http://api.geneontology.org/api/bioentity/function/GO:0140374/genes?evidence=ECO%3A0000006&relationship_type=involved_in
## Output: write_memory
## Options:
## * useragent: libcurl/7.58.0 r-curl/4.3 httr/1.4.1
## * connecttimeout: 60
## * httpget: TRUE
## Headers:
## * Accept: application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*
```

---

## Web API Example 1: Gene Ontology (cont. 2)

Let's take a look at the response:

```{r example-gene-ontology-cont, cache=TRUE}
go_query
```

Remember the codes:
- 1xx: Information message
- 2xx: Success
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client error
- 5xx: Server error
---

## Web API Example 1: Gene Ontology (cont. 3)

We can extract the results using the `httr::content()` function

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(httr)
```


```{r get-contents-go, dependson="example-gene-ontology"}
dat <- content(go_query) 
dat <- lapply(dat$associations, function(a) {
  data.frame(
    Gene        = a$subject$id,
    taxon_id    = a$subject$taxon$id,
    taxon_label = a$subject$taxon$label
  )
})
dat <- do.call(rbind, dat)
str(dat)
```


---

## Web API Example 1: Gene Ontology (cont. 4)

The structure of the result will depend on the API. In this case, the output was a JSON file, so the content function returns a list in R. In other scenarios it could return an XML object (we will see more in the lab)

```{r get-contents-go-print}
knitr::kable(head(dat),
  caption = "Genes experimentally annotated with the function\
  **antiviral innate immune response** (GO:0140374)"
  )
```

---

## Web API Example 2: Using Tokens

- Sometimes, APIs are not completely open, you need to register.

- The API may require to login (user+password), or pass a token.

- In this example, I'm using a token which I obtained [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token)

- You can find information about the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)
  API [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)

---

## Web API Example 2: Using Tokens (cont. 1)

- The way to pass the token will depend on the API service.

- Some require authentication, others need you to pass it as an argument of the query,
  i.e., directly in the URL.
  
- In this case, we pass it on the header.
  
  ```{r donwload-climate-data, eval = FALSE}
  stations_api <- GET(
    url    = "https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov",
    path   = "cdo-web/api/v2/stations",
    config = add_headers(
      token = "[YOUR TOKEN HERE]"
      ),
    query  = list(limit = 1000)
  )
  ```
  
  
  This is equivalent to using the following query
  
  ```bash
  curl --header "token: [YOUR TOKEN HERE]" \
    https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/stations?limit=1000
  ```

**Note**: This won't run, you need to get your own token

---

## Web API Example 2: Using Tokens (cont. 2)

Again, we can recover the data using the `content()` function:

```{r download-climate-data-cont, eval = FALSE}
ans <- content(stations_api)
ans$results[[1]]
## $elevation
## [1] 139
## 
## $mindate
## [1] "1948-01-01"
## 
## $maxdate
## [1] "2014-01-01"
## 
## $latitude
## [1] 31.5702
## 
## $name
## [1] "ABBEVILLE, AL US"
## 
## $datacoverage
## [1] 0.8813
## 
## $id
## [1] "COOP:010008"
```

---

## Web API Example 3: HHS health recommendation

Here is a last example. We will use the Department of Health and Human Services
API for "[...] demographic-specific health recommendations" (details at [health.gov](https://health.gov/our-work/health-literacy/consumer-health-content/free-web-content/apis-developers/documentation))

```{r health-advice, cache=TRUE}
health_advises <- GET(
  url  = "https://health.gov/",
  path = "myhealthfinder/api/v3/myhealthfinder.json",
  query = list(
    lang = "en",
    age  = "32",
    sex  = "male",
    tobaccoUse = 0
  ),
  config = c(
    add_headers(accept = "application/json"),
    config(connecttimeout = 60)
  )
)
```

---

## Web API Example 3: HHS health recommendation (cont. 1)

Let's see the response

```{r health-advice-response}
health_advises
```


---

## Web API Example 3: HHS health recommendation (cont. 2)

```{r health-advice-print, results='asis'}
# Extracting the content
health_advises_ans <- content(health_advises)

# Getting the titles
txt <- with(health_advises_ans$Result$Resources, c(
  sapply(All$Resource, "[[", "Title"),
  sapply(Some$Resource, "[[", "Title"),
  sapply(Interest$Resource, "[[", "Title")
))
cat(txt, sep = "; ")
```

---

## Summary

- We learned about regular expressions with the package **stringr** (a wrapper of **stringi**)

- We can use regular expressions to detect (`str_detect()`), replace (`str_replace()`), and 
extract (`str_extract()`) expressions.

- We looked at web scraping using the **rvest** package (a wrapper of **xml2**).

- We extracted elements from the HTML/XML using `xml_find_all()` with XPath expressions.

- We also used the `html_table()` function from rvest to extract tables from HTML documents.

- We took a quick review on Web APIs and the Hyper-text-transfer-protocol (HTTP).

- We used the **httr** R package (wrapper of **curl**) to make `GET` requests to various APIs

- We even showed an example using a token passed via the `header`.

- Once we got the responses, we used the `content()` function to extract the message of the
response.

## Detour on CURL options

Sometimes you will need to change the default set of options in CURL. You can
checkout the list of options in `curl::curl_options()`. A common hack is to 
extend the time-limit before dropping the conection, e.g.:

Using the **Health IT** API from the US government, we can obtain the
**Electronic Prescribing Adoption and Use by County** (see docs
[here](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/datadashboard/documentation/electronic-prescribing-adoption-use-data-documentation-county.php))

The problem is that it usually takes longer to get the data, so we pass 
the config option `connecttimeout` (which corresponds to the flag `--connect-timeout`)
in the curl call (see next slide)

---

## Detour on CURL options (cont.)

```{r eval = FALSE}
ans <- httr::GET(
  url    = "https://dashboard.healthit.gov/api/open-api.php",
  query  = list(
    source = "AHA_2008-2015.csv",
    region = "California",
    period = 2015
    ),
  config = config(
    connecttimeout = 60
    )
)
```

```r
> ans$request
# <request>
# GET https://dashboard.healthit.gov/api/open-api.php?source=AHA_2008-2015.csv&region=California&period=2015
# Output: write_memory
# Options:
# * useragent: libcurl/7.58.0 r-curl/4.3 httr/1.4.1
# * connecttimeout: 60
# * httpget: TRUE
# Headers:
# * Accept: application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*
```
