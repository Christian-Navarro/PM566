# Introduction to interactive visualization

---

## What is interactive visualization?

- Interactive visualization involves the creation and sharing of interactive data objects

- Interactive data objects are graphical representations of data, model, or results that allow a user to directly manipulate and explore

- Some example products and packages in R:
--

  - Interactive plots (`Plotly`)
  
  - Interactive maps (`plotly`, `Leaflet`)
  
  - Interactive tables (`formattable`, `DT`)
  
  - Dashboards (`flexdashboard`)
  
  - Interactive applications (`shiny`)
  
  - Websites (Static using `R Markdown`, `blogdown`, `Hugo`, `Jeckyll`)

---

## What is interactive visualization (cont'd)

- Interactivity allows users to engage with data, a model, algorithm, or other visualization in a way that static visuals cannot

- Features of interactivity include: 
--
  
  - Identify, isolate, and visualize information for extended periods of time 

  - Zoom in and out

  - Highlight relevant information
    
  - Get more information
  
  - Filter
    
  - Animate
  
  - Change parameters

---

# Why use interactive visualization?

  - In this course we’ve covered visualization and in particular how `ggplot()` can help to make static plots with many dimensions

  - But what if you want to explore a third or fourth dimension of data -- quickly? Or without all the noise? Or identify strange values?

  - Or, what if you want to communicate your findings to an external audience? Specifically, if you want that audience to engage with or explore the data?

Interactive visualization helps with both the **exploration** and **communication** parts of the data science process

---

## Interactive Visualization for **exploratory data analysis** (EDA)

- Interactive graphics are well suited to aid the exploration of high-dimensional or otherwise complex data

- Interacting with information in a visual way helps to enable insights that wouldn’t be easy or even possible with static graphics, for reasons including:

--
  - **Investigate faster**: In a true exploratory setting, you have to make lots of visualizations, and investigate lots of follow-up questions, before stumbling across something truly valuable. Interactive visualization can aid in the sense-making process by searching for information quickly without fully specified questions (Unwin and Hofmann 1999)

--

  - **Identifying relationships or structure that would otherwise go missing** (J. W. Tukey and Fisherkeller 1973)

--

  - **Understand and diagnose problems with data, models, or algorithms** (Wickham, Cook, and Hofmann 2015)

---

## Interactive Visualization for **EDA** (cont'd)

  - In a true exploratory setting, you have to make lots of visualizations, and investigate lots of follow-up questions, before stumbling across something truly valuable

  - Although interactivity can augment EDA, it’s typically only *practical* when we can create and alter visuals quickly

  - Plotly and Leaflet are well suited to these tasks -- they make the added effort required to enable functionality relatively small

---

## Interactive Visualization for **EDA** (cont'd)

- Use the LA times data -- show the erroneous value

---

## Interactive visualization for **communication**

- Engagement with information has been shown to improve the ability to retain information

<div style="text-align: center;">

  </figure>
  <figcaption><b>Edgar Dale's Cone of Learning</b></figcaption>
</div>

---

## Interactive visualization for **communication** (cont'd)

- Automate and efficiently share multiple dimensions of data/models/findings or complex analysis tasks

- Help users to better understand, and make decisions on, data/models/findings

  </figure>
  <figcaption><b>EpiModel Shiny app for COVID testing at universities</b></figcaption>
</div>

---

## Interactive visualization for **communication** (cont'd)

- Tell a more interesting or engaging story, presenting multiple viewpoints of data

- Allow users to focus on the aspects most important to them, making the user more likely to understand, learn from, remember and appreciate the data

<div style="text-align: center;">

# Plan for today

- Survey of interactive graphics in both of their uses: exploration and communication 

  - We're going to look at creating interactive graphs, maps, and tables with `Plotly`, `Leaflet`, and `formattable`

  - We will look at how to share these plots
  
  - You will create your own project website using RStudio and GitHub pages

  - We will survey other possibilities (Shiny apps, dashboards)


---

## What is Plotly?

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <figure>
    <img style="width: 200px;vertical-align: middle;"  hspace="20px" src="img/plotly.png" alt="Plotly"
  </figure>
</div>

  - Plotly is a web application for creating and sharing interactive graphics

  - Is powered by JavaScript graphing library plotly.js and is designed on principles of adding layers

  - Plotly can work with several programming languages and applications including R, JavaScript,
Python, Matlab, and Excel. 

--- 


## Install Plotly

Installing Plotly is easy

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
```

---

## Load data for examples

```{r, message=FALSE}
# load the plotly R package
library(plotly)

# load the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 package
data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")
diamonds
```

---

## `plot_ly()` vs. `ggplotly()`

- There are two main ways to create a plotly object:

  - Transforming a `ggplot2` object (via `ggplotly()`) into a plotly object 

  - Directly initializing a plotly object with `plot_ly()`/`plot_geo()`/`plot_mapbox()`
  
- Both approaches are powered by the JavaScript graphing library plotly.js so many of the same concepts and tools that you learn for one interface can be reused in the other

---

## `plot_ly()`

- Any graph made with the **plotly** R package is powered by the JavaScript library [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) 

- The `plot_ly()` function provides a 'direct' interface to plotly.js with some additional abstractions to help reduce typing. 

- If we assign variable names (e.g., `cut`, `clarity`, etc.) to visual properties (e.g., `x`, `y`, `color`, etc.), `plot_ly()` tries to find a sensible geometric representation of that information for us

--- 

## `plot_ly()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, y = ~clarity)
```

---

## `plot_ly()`

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, y = ~clarity)
```


--- 

## `plot_ly()` functionality

The `plot_ly()` function has numerous arguments that are unique to the R package (e.g., `color`, `stroke`, `span`, `symbol`, `linetype`, etc.) and make it easier to encode data variables (e.g., diamond clarity) as visual properties (e.g., color). By default, these arguments map values of a data variable to a visual range defined by the plural form of the argument. 

In this example, `color` is used to map each level of diamond clarity to a different color. Then, `colors` is used to specify the range of colors (which, in this case, the `"Accent"` color palette from the **RColorBrewer** package, but one can also supply custom color codes or a color palette function like `colorRamp()`).

---

## `plot_ly()` functionality

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, color = ~clarity, colors = "Accent")
```

---

## `plot_ly()` functionality

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, color = ~clarity, colors = "Accent")
```

--- 

## `layout()` 

- (almost) every function anticipates a **plotly** object as input to its first argument and returns a modified version of that **plotly** object. 

- For example, the `layout()` function anticipates a **plotly** object in its first argument and its other arguments add and/or modify various layout components of that object (e.g., the title):

---

## `layout()` 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
layout(
  plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut),
  title = "My beatiful histogram"
)
```

---

## `layout()` 

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
layout(
  plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut),
  title = "My beatiful histogram"
)
```

---

## `layout()` 

or using the `%>%` operator from the **magrittr** package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~cut) %>%
  layout(title = "My beatiful histogram")
```

--- 

## Layers and `add_*()` 

- In addition to `layout()` for adding/modifying part(s) of the graph's layout, there are also a family of `add_*()` functions (e.g., `add_histogram()`, `add_lines()`, etc.) that define how to render data into geometric objects. 

- These functions add a graphical layer to a plot. A *layer* can be thought of as a group of graphical elements that can be sufficiently described using only 5 components: 

  - data
  - aesthetic mappings (e.g., assigning `clarity` to `color`)
  - a geometric representation (e.g., rectangles, circles, etc.)
  - statistical transformations (e.g., sum, mean, etc.)
  - positional adjustments (e.g., dodge, stack, etc.). 

---


## Layers and `add_*()` 

Let's add an `add_histogram()` layer:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  plot_ly() %>% 
  add_histogram(x = ~cut)
```

--- 

## Layers and `add_*()` 

Let's add an `add_histogram()` layer:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  plot_ly() %>% 
  add_histogram(x = ~cut)
```

---

## Basic Scatterplot

A basic scatterplot is easy to make, with the added benefit of tooltips that
appear when your mouse hovers over each point. Specify a scatterplot by
indicating `type = "scatter"`. Notice that the arguments for the `x` and `y` 
variables as specified as formulas, with the tilde operator (`~`) preceding the
variable that you're plotting.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter")
```

---

## Basic Scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter")
```

---

## Scatterplot Color

You can add color to your scatterplot points according to a categorical variable
in the data frame you use with `plot_ly()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~factor(cyl))
```

---

## Scatterplot Color

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~factor(cyl))
```

---

## Continuous Color

You can also show continuous variables with color in scatterplots.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~disp)
```

---

## Continuous Color

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~disp)
```

---

## Scatterplot Sizing

By specifying the `size` argument you can make each point in your scatterplot a
different size.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", 
        color = ~factor(cyl), size = ~hp)
```

---

## Scatterplot Sizing

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", 
        color = ~factor(cyl), size = ~hp)
```

---

## 3D Scatterplot

You can create a three-dimensional scatterplot with the `type = "scatter3d"`
argument. If you click and drag these scatterplots you can view them from
different angles.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2016-07-21)
temp <- rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 5)
pressue <- rnorm(100)
dtime <- 1:100
plot_ly(x = ~temp, y = ~pressue, z = ~dtime,
        type = "scatter3d", color = ~temp)
```

---

## 3D Scatterplot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(2016-07-21)
temp <- rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 5)
pressue <- rnorm(100)
dtime <- 1:100
plot_ly(x = ~temp, y = ~pressue, z = ~dtime,
        type = "scatter3d", color = ~temp)
```

---

## Line Graph

Line graphs are the default graph for `plot_ly()`. They're of course useful for
showing change over time:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data("airmiles")
plot_ly(x = ~time(airmiles), y = ~airmiles, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```

---

## Line Graph

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data("airmiles")
plot_ly(x = ~time(airmiles), y = ~airmiles, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```

---

## Multi Line Graph

You can show multiple lines by specifying the column in the data frame that
separates the lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("EuStockMarkets")

stocks <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) %>%
  gather(index, price) %>%
  mutate(time = rep(time(EuStockMarkets), 4))

plot_ly(stocks, x = ~time, y = ~price, color = ~index, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```

---

## Multi Line Graph

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("EuStockMarkets")

stocks <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) %>%
  gather(index, price) %>%
  mutate(time = rep(time(EuStockMarkets), 4))

plot_ly(stocks, x = ~time, y = ~price, color = ~index, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```

---

## Histogram

A histogram is great for showing how counts of data are distributed. Use the
`type = "histogram"` argument.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(x = ~precip, type = "histogram")
```

---

## Histogram

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(x = ~precip, type = "histogram")
```

---

## Boxplot

Boxplots are wonderful for comparing how different datasets are distributed.
Specify `type = "box"` to create a boxplot.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(iris, y = ~Petal.Length, color = ~Species, type = "box")
```

---

## Boxplot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(iris, y = ~Petal.Length, color = ~Species, type = "box")
```

---

## Heatmap

Heatmaps are useful for displaying three dimensional data in two dimensions,
using color for the third dimension. Create a heatmap by using the
`type = "heatmap"` argument.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
terrain1 <- matrix(rnorm(100*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
plot_ly(z = ~terrain1, type = "heatmap")
```

---

## Heatmap

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
terrain1 <- matrix(rnorm(100*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
plot_ly(z = ~terrain1, type = "heatmap")
```

---

## 3D Surface

Why limit yourself to two dimensions when you can render three dimensions on a
computer!? Create moveable 3D surfaces with `type = "surface"`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
terrain2 <- matrix(sort(rnorm(100*100)), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
plot_ly(z = ~terrain2, type = "surface")
```

---

## 3D Surface

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
terrain2 <- matrix(sort(rnorm(100*100)), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
plot_ly(z = ~terrain2, type = "surface")
```

---

## Choropleth Maps: Setup

Choropleth maps illustrate data across geographic areas by shading regions with
different colors. Choropleth maps are easy to make with Plotly though they
require more setup compared to other Plotly graphics.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create data frame
state_pop <- data.frame(State = state.abb, Pop = as.vector(state.x77[,1]))
# Create hover text
state_pop$hover <- with(state_pop, paste(State, '<br>', "Population:", Pop))
# Make state borders white
borders <- list(color = toRGB("red"))
# Set up some mapping options
map_options <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  showlakes = TRUE,
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)
```

---

## Choropleth Maps: Mapping

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(z = ~state_pop$Pop, text = ~state_pop$hover, locations = ~state_pop$State, 
        type = 'choropleth', locationmode = 'USA-states', 
        color = state_pop$Pop, colors = 'Blues', marker = list(line = borders)) %>%
  layout(title = 'US Population in 1975', geo = map_options)
```

---

## Choropleth Maps

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create data frame
state_pop <- data.frame(State = state.abb, Pop = as.vector(state.x77[,1]))
# Create hover text
state_pop$hover <- with(state_pop, paste(State, '<br>', "Population:", Pop))
# Make state borders white
borders <- list(color = toRGB("red"))
# Set up some mapping options
map_options <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  showlakes = TRUE,
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)

plot_ly(z = ~state_pop$Pop, text = ~state_pop$hover, locations = ~state_pop$State, 
        type = 'choropleth', locationmode = 'USA-states', 
        color = state_pop$Pop, colors = 'Blues', marker = list(line = borders)) %>%
  layout(title = 'US Population in 1975', geo = map_options)
```

---

# `ggplotly()`

- So far we've focused on `plot_ly()`. We also have the option of working with `ggplotly()` function from the **plotly** package, which has the ability to translate **ggplot2** to **plotly**. 

- This functionality can be really helpful for quickly adding interactivity to your existing **ggplot2** workflow.

- Moreover, even if you know `plot_ly()` and plotly.js well, `ggplotly()` can still be desirable for creating visualizations that aren't necessarily straightforward to achieve without it. 

--- 

## `ggplotly()` THIS IS WHERE I CAN PUT THE LATIMES DATA EXAMPLE TO SHOW HOW EASY TO GET A GGPLOTLY

To demonstrate, let's explore the relationship between `price` and other variables from the well-known `diamonds` dataset. 

Hexagonal binning (i.e., `geom_hex()`) is useful way to visualize a 2D density, like the relationship between `price` and `carat`. We can see there is a strong positive linear relationship between the _log_ of carat and price. It also shows that for many, the carat is only rounded to a particular number (indicated by the light blue bands) and no diamonds are priced around $1500. Making this plot interactive makes it easier to decode the hexagonal colors into the counts that they represent.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = log(carat), y = log(price))) + 
  geom_hex(bins = 100)
ggplotly(p)
```

--- 

## `ggplotly()` for statistical summaries

We may use `ggplotly()` over `plot_ly()` to leverage **ggplot2**'s consistent and expressive interface for exploring statistical summaries across groups. For example, by including a discrete `color` variable (e.g., `cut`) with `geom_freqpoly()`, you get a frequency polygon for each level of that variable. This ability to quickly generate visual encodings of statistical summaries across an arbitrary number of groups works for basically any geom (e.g., `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`, etc.) and is a key feature of **ggplot2**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = log(price), color = clarity)) + 
    geom_freqpoly()
ggplotly(p)
```

---

## `ggplotly()` functionality

```{r}
p<- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=price, fill=clarity)) + geom_bar(position="stack", stat = 'identity')
ggplotly(p)
```


--- 

## `ggplotly()` for statistical summaries

Now, to see how `price` varies with both `cut` and `clarity`, we could repeat this same visualization for each level of `cut`. This is where **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()` comes in handy. Moreover, to facilitate comparisons, we can have `geom_freqpoly()` display relative rather than absolute frequencies. By making this plot interactive, we can more easily compare particular levels of clarity by leveraging the legend filtering capabilities. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = log(price), color = clarity)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(stat = "density") + 
    facet_wrap(~cut)
ggplotly(p)

```

---

# Publishing views

Both `plot_ly()` and `ggplotly()` objects and be computed directly as part of an R Markdown file, which means they will show up on a website you create using R Markdown and GitHub pages.

But you may want to save and embed the interactive HTML file, or a static image based on the file.

---

## Saving and embedding HTML

Any widget made from any **htmlwidgets** package (e.g., **plotly**, **leaflet**, **DT**, etc.) can be saved as a standalone HTML file via the `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()` function. By default, it produces a completely self-contained HTML file, meaning that all the necessary JavaScript and CSS dependency files are bundled inside the HTML file. 

If you want to embed numerous widgets in a larger HTML document, save all the dependency files externally into a single directory. You can do this by setting `selfcontained = FALSE` and specifying a fixed `libdir` in `saveWidget()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(htmlwidgets)
p <- plot_ly(x = rnorm(100))
saveWidget(p, "p1.html", selfcontained = F, libdir = "lib")
saveWidget(p, "p2.html", selfcontained = F, libdir = "lib")
```

- If you want to share your visualizations on https://plot.ly/ you can make an
account on their site

---

## Saving a static image

- With code (convenient if you need to output many static images): Any **plotly** object can be saved as a static image via the `orca()` function.

- From a browser (convenient if you want to manually post-process an image): By default, the 'download plot' icon in the modebar will download to PNG and use the `height` and `width` of the plot, but these defaults can be altered via the plot's configuration, e.g.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly() %>%
  config(
    toImageButtonOptions = list(
      format = "svg",
      filename = "myplot",
      width = 600,
      height = 700
    )
  )
```

---

# Interactive tables

We don't have time to go into a lot of the details but we recommend checking out

The `DT` package, which creates a **DataTable** html widgets out of data.frames, or out of `formattable` objects, i.e.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(DT)
library(formattable)
formattable::as.datatable(formattable(iris))
```

---
