<h2>Course objectives</h2>
<p>This course serves as an introduction to data science with focus on the acquisition and analysis of real-life data. Students will learn the toolsets needed to 1) create workable and reproducible datasets by accessing, scraping, sampling and cleaning data; 2) conduct exploratory data analysis and data visualizations; 3) apply statistical tools to learn from data; and 4) build functions and basic apps. Coding languages R and Python will be used.</p>

<h2>Description and Assessment of Assignments</h2>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong> There will be 5-6 assignments given throughout the semester, approximately every week. Students may discuss the problems with one another, however, individual solutions must be submitted and copying will not be tolerated. All assignments must be completed in R Markdown, and submitted through the Github classes portal of the course. Late assignments will be penalized by 20% for each day past the due date.</p>
<p><strong>Exams:</strong> There will be one in-class exam (midterm 2hrs). It will be conducted on your laptop using the tools learned up to that point in the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Final Project:</strong> The final project will be to develop a reproducible R package, Shiny app, or pipeline for analysis applied to a real-world dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Labs:</strong> Lab attendance is mandatory and participation in the lab is required and counts as part of the overall lab grade.</p>
