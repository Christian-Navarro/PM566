## Course objectives

This course serves as an introduction to data science with focus on the acquisition and analysis of real-life data. Students will learn the toolsets needed to 1) create workable and reproducible datasets by accessing, scraping, sampling and cleaning data; 2) conduct exploratory data analysis and data visualizations; 3) apply statistical tools to learn from data; and 4) build functions and basic apps. Coding languages R and Python will be used.

## Learning Objectives

Through this course, students will become familiar with the techniques used in Data Science, applied to health-related datasets. Students will learn:

- Programming in R, and associated tools Markdown, Git
- Data visualization – summarizing data through interpretable summaires
- Data collection – data scraping, wrangling, cleaning, and sampling
- Exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition
- Basic statistical algorithms
- Building software packages and apps

**Prerequisite(s):** None

**Recommended Preparation:** Undergraduate course in statistics and programming

## Course Notes

Lecture notes presented in class will be posted on GitHub.

## Technological Proficiency and Hardware/Software Required 

Computation using R (downloaded from http://cran.r-project.org), and development tools including Git (https://github.com/) and Markdown will be used throughout the semester.

## Description and Assessment of Assignments

**Assignments:** There will be 5-6 assignments given throughout the semester, approximately every week. Students may discuss the problems with one another, however, individual solutions must be submitted and copying will not be tolerated. All assignments must be completed in R Markdown, and submitted through the Github classes portal of the course. Late assignments will be penalized by 20% for each day past the due date.

**Exams:** There will be one in-class exam (midterm 2hrs). It will be conducted on your laptop using the tools learned up to that point in the semester.

**Final Project:** The final project will be to develop a reproducible R package, Shiny app, or pipeline for analysis applied to a real-world dataset.

**Labs:** Lab attendance is mandatory and participation in the lab is required and counts as part of the overall lab grade.

## Grading Breakdown

| Assignment           | % of Grade |
|----------------------|------------|
| Labs                 | 10%        |
| Homework (6)         | 30%        |
| In-Class Quizzes (3) | 10%        |
| Midterm Exam         | 20%        |
| Final Project        | 30%        |
| TOTAL                | 100%       |

## Assignment Submission Policy

Assignments shall be submitted on the Github classroom portal of the course. Late homework assignments will not be accepted without penalty, except when verifiable extenuating circumstances can be demonstrated.

## Schedule

`r blogdown::shortcode("topiclist")`

As the weeks go by, consult the [Schedule Page](/schedule/) for more information on weekly topics, problem sets, readings, and other materials. The schedule is likely to change as we go. Links to readings, assignments, and other materials from class will be posted on that page. 


## Statement for students with disabilities

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to me (or to TA) as early in the semester as possible. DSP is located in STU 301 and is open 8:30 a.m.–5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The phone number for DSP is (213) 740-0776.

## Statement on academic conduct and support systems

### Academic Conduct:

Plagiarism – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in
your own words – is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please
familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11,
“Behavior Violating University Standards” policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b. Other forms
of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus
and university policies on scientific misconduct, policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.
