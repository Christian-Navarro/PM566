<h1>Learning Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read in and get familiar with the meteorology dataset<br />
</li>
<li>Step through the EDA “checklist” presented in the class slides</li>
<li>Practice making exploratory graphs</li>

<h1>Lab Description</h1>
<p>We will work with the meteorological data presented in lecture. Recall the dataset consists of weather station readings in the continental US.</p>
<p><strong>The objective of the lab is to find the weather station with the highest elevation and look at patterns in the time series of its wind speed and temperature.</strong></p>

<p>It looks like the elevation variable has observations with 9999.0, which is probably an indicator for missing. We should take a deeper look at the data dictionary to confirm. The wind speed variable is ok but there are a lot of missing data.</p>
<p>After checking the data we should make the appropriate modifications. Replace elevations with 9999 as <code>NA</code>.</p>

<p>At what elevation is the highest weather station?</p>
<ul>
<li>The weather station with highest elevation is 4113 meters. This is after replacing 9999.0 values with the appropriate code for “missing”, which is “NA”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have the issue of the minimum temperature being -40C, so we should remove those observations.</p>
