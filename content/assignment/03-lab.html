<h1>Learning Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read in and get familiar with the meteorology dataset<br />

<h1>Lab Description</h1>
<p>We will work with the meteorological data presented in lecture. Recall the dataset consists of weather station readings in the continental US.</p>
<p><strong>The objective of the lab is to find the weather station with the highest elevation and look at patterns in the time series of its wind speed and temperature.</strong></p>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<div id="read-in-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Read in the data</h3>
<p>First download and then read in with data.table:fread()</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz&quot;,
              &quot;met_all.gz&quot;, method=&quot;libcurl&quot;, timeout = 60)
met &lt;- data.table::fread(&quot;met_all.gz&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="check-the-dimensions-headers-footers.-how-many-columns-rows-are-there" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Check the dimensions, headers, footers. How many columns, rows are there?</h3>
</div>
<div id="take-a-look-at-the-variables." class="section level3">
<h3>3. Take a look at the variables.</h3>
</div>
<div id="take-a-closer-look-at-the-key-variables." class="section level3">
<h3>4. Take a closer look at the key variables.</h3>
<p>It looks like the elevation variable has observations with 9999.0, which is probably an indicator for missing. We should take a deeper look at the data dictionary to confirm. The wind speed variable is ok but there are a lot of missing data.</p>
<p>After checking the data we should make the appropriate modifications. Replace elevations with 9999 as <code>NA</code>.</p>
<p>At what elevation is the highest weather station?</p>
<p>We also have the issue of the minimum temperature being -40C, so we should remove those observations.</p>
<p>We again notice that there is a -17.2C temperature reading that seems suspicious.</p>
</div>
<div id="check-the-data-against-an-external-data-source." class="section level3">
<h3>5. Check the data against an external data source.</h3>
<p>We should check the suspicious temperature value (where is it located?) and validate that the range of elevations make sense (-13 m to 4113 m).</p>
<p>Google is your friend here.</p>
<p>Fix any problems that arise in your checks.</p>
</div>
<div id="calculate-summary-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Calculate summary statistics</h3>
<p>Remember to keep the initial question in mind. We want to pick out the weather station with maximum elevation and examine its windspeed and temperature.</p>
<p>Some ideas: select the weather station with maximum elevation; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed with hour and day of the month.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>elev &lt;- met[elev==max(elev)]</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-graphs" class="section level3">
<h3>7. Exploratory graphs</h3>
<p>We should look at the distributions of all of the key variables to make sure there are no remaining issues with the data.</p>
<p>One thing we should consider for later analyses is to log transform wind speed and elevation as the are very skewed.</p>
<p>Look at where the weather station with highest elevation is located.</p>
<p>Look at the time series of temperature and wind speed at this location. For this we will need to create a date-time variable for the x-axis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(lubridate)
elev$date &lt;- with(elev, ymd_h(paste(year, month, day, hour, sep= &#39; &#39;)))
summary(elev$date)</code></pre>
<p>With the date-time variable we can plot the time series of temperature and wind speed.</p>
<p>Summarize any trends that you see in these time series plots.</p>
