**Learning Objective**:
To apply the skills learned in PM 566 (through Week 6) by analyzing and
interpreting a dataset of your choice.

**Narrative**:
As we have discussed in class, the practice of data science requires both
quantitative skills and qualitative knowledge of the domain from which the data
was collected. The first step in any data analysis is to have a dataset for
which you have formulated an interesting question. If you do not have a dataset
to work with, you may choose one from our [list of
suggestions](../references.qmd#data). With your dataset, formulate a clear and
concise question to answer and conduct data wrangling, exploratory data
analysis, and data visualization to explore/answer this question.

**Deliverable**:
A *written report* generated in Quarto (HTML or PDF) with embedded tables and
figures that is submitted to a project-specific GitHub repository that you
create. The report should have the following sections: 

 - Introduction - provide background on your dataset and formulated question
 - Data Preparation - how and where the data were acquired, how you cleaned and 
 wrangled the data
 - Exploratory Analysis - dataset characteristics, variables included, 
 distribution of key variables
 - Preliminary Results - analysis of the primary research question and any 
 subsequent follow-up questions, including summary statistics in tabular form 
 and publication-quality figures (look at the `kable()` function from `knitr` 
 for making nice tables)
 - a brief Conclusion - summary of what you found in the data

In your report, please do not include any unformatted text output (e.g. output
from `head()`, `str()`, `print()`, etc.). You should summarize these aspects of
your data within the text, figures, and/or tables.

Note that you cannot use the same dataset on both the Midterm and Final. So if
you came into this class with a dataset that you wanted to analyze, you may want
to save that for later.
