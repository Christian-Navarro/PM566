## Text Mining

A new dataset has been added to the data science data repository
<https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/tree/master/03_pubmed>. The
dataset contains 3,241 abstracts from articles collected via 5 PubMed searches.
The search terms are listed in the second column, `term` and these will serve as
the "documents." Your job is to analyze these abstracts to find interesting
insights.

1.  Tokenize the abstracts and count the number of each token. Do you see
anything interesting? Does removing stop words change what tokens appear as the
most frequent? What are the 5 most common tokens for each search term after
removing stop words?
2.  Tokenize the abstracts into bigrams. Find the 10 most common bigrams and
visualize them.
3.  Calculate the TF-IDF value for each word-search term combination (here you
want the search term to be the "document"). What are the 5 tokens from each
search term with the highest TF-IDF value? How are the results different from
the answers you got in Question 1?

## Sentiment Analysis

1.  Perform a sentiment analysis using the NRC lexicon. What is the most common
sentiment for each search term? What if you remove `"positive"` and `"negative"`
from the list?
2.  Now perform a sentiment analysis using the AFINN lexicon to get an average
positivity score for each abstract (hint: you may want to create a variable that
indexes, or counts, the abstracts). Create a visualization that shows these
scores grouped by search term. Are any search terms noticeably different from
the others?
