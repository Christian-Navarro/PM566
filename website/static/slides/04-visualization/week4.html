<h2>Basic Scatterplot 2</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>geom_point()</code> adds a layer of points to your plot, to create a scatterplot.</li>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot.</li>
<li>Each geom function in <code>ggplot2</code> takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties.</li>
<li>The mapping argument is always paired with <code>aes()</code>, and the x and y arguments of <code>aes()</code> specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the data argument, in this case, met_avg</li>
<li>One common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the <code>+</code> in the wrong place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start.</li>
