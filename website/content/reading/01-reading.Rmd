# Required reading

You are expected to have read this when you show up for the first day of class. The following items are all rather short and shouldn't take too long.
The "How to read an R help page" section stops once you reach "A.1.2 The basics of accessing and selecting things".

- The [Syllabus](/PM566/syllabus)
- rmarkdown lessons [1](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), [2](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html), [3](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html) and [8](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html)
- [How to read an R help page](https://socviz.co/appendix.html#a-little-more-about-r)

Additionally depending on your previous knowledge I would recommend you take a look at the [programming basics primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2).

# Optional reading

The following articles are recommended (but not expected) for you to read if you want to get a glimpse into the world of data science and R as a language.

- [How R changed me as an analyst](https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/how-r-changed-me-as-an-analyst/)
- [Data scientists mostly just do arithmetic and thatâ€™s a good thing](https://m.signalvnoise.com/data-scientists-mostly-just-do-arithmetic-and-thats-a-good-thing/)
- [How rOpenSci uses Code Review to Promote Reproducible Science](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/01/nf-softwarereview/)
- [50 Years of Data Science](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734)
