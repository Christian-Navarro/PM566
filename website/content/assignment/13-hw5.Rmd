## Interactive Visualization I and II

1. Using your midterm/final project data, create 3 different interactive visualizations using the tools learned in week 11 class/lab.

2. Include the visualizations created in (1) on your final project website hosted on `GitHub Pages`.

3. Rename your final project website by modifying the relevant text in the `.yml` configuration file and the YAML header in the `index.Rmd` file. You may also modify the name of your GitHub repo so that the website url also provides a descriptive name.

**Extra Credit**: Create content across 2 pages on your website. You can use the example content from [Lab 12](https://github.com/AbigailHorn/PM566-final-project) as an example.
