<h1>Final Project</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Presentation (5 minutes): Friday December 3, 2021</p></li>
<li><p>Written report (single spaced, 6-8 pages where 3-4 pages are tables and figures): Friday December 10, 2021</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning Objective</strong>: To apply the skills learned in
PM 566 by analyzing and interpreting a dataset of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong>: Through this project you will launch a
portfolio of data science projects that will become seminal for your job
hunt.</p>
<p>Using the dataset from your midterm, make sure you have
formulated a clear and concise question to answer. You will apply the
skills learned throughout the semester to answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: 1) A 5-minute presentation where you
walk us through your website; 2) A written report with embedded tables
and figures that is submitted as a PDF to a final project-specific
github repository <em>and</em> as a downloadable link on your website.
Please see the checklist below for additional
details.</p>
<p>The report should have the following sections (elaborate
from what was written in the midterm):
<strong>Introduction</strong> (provide background on your
dataset and formulated question), <strong>Methods</strong>
(include how and where the data were acquired, how you cleaned and
wrangled the data, what tools you used for data exploration),
<strong>Results</strong> (provide final, publication ready
tables and figures from your analysis, refer to your website if needed),
and a brief <strong>Conclusion and Summary</strong> where
you describe your findings.</p>
<p>In your report, please do not include code (so make sure
<code>echo = FALSE</code>), unformatted output, or dataset summaries (e.g. output
from head(), str(), etc.)</p>

<h2>Checklist for Final Project</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Create a website</strong> (HTML document and all the
required files, including figures). It should feature:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span dir="ltr">A brief description of the project,</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr">Interactive visualizations, also with a
description so that people can understand what they are
looking at, and</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr">A link to the PDF version of the actual report
(i.e. a link to “Download the report.”).</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr">Your home page should feature no more than
five interactive tables and figures. If you want to include
more to showcase your skills, we request you do so by adding
extra pages to the website. We will only evaluate the homepage
of the website.</span></p>
<p>The actual analysis should be included in the PDF
report. <strong>The PDF report can refer to visualizations included in the
website</strong>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Upload everything</strong>, source code, website files,
and PDF report, to the GitHub repository.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr">Make sure that the <strong>website</strong>, which is to be
<strong>hosted in GitHub pages</strong>, actually <strong>works</strong>, i.e., figures and
interactive visualizations are properly rendered when visiting the
website..</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Have a README.md file</strong> in the upper level of
the repository. This file provides general information about the
project, like title, brief description, etc.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr">The <strong>README.md file links to the website</strong>, e.g.
<a href="https://username.github.io/pm566-project" class="uri">https://username.github.io/pm566-project</a>, .</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr">Have a <strong>“data” folder</strong> with either the data or
instructions about how to acquire it. You should provide the
instructions in a README.md within that folder.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span dir="ltr"><strong>(optional)</strong> Your document is <strong>fully
reproducible</strong>, meaning you don’t have paths to files not shared
in the repository. For example, if you are loading a dataset with
“fread,” it should be something like
“fread(“<a href="https://data.com/dataset.csv" class="uri">https://data.com/dataset.csv</a>”),” so you are directly
using data online, or “fread(“data/dataset.csv”),” so the data
needed has been shared on GitHub and is contained in the path
“data/dataset.csv.”</span></p></li>
