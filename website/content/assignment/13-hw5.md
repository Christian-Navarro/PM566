2. Include the visualizations created in (1) on your final project website hosted on `GitHub Pages`.

3. Rename your final project website by modifying the relevant text in the `.yml` configuration file and the YAML header in the `index.Rmd` file. You may also modify the name of your GitHub repo so that the website url also provides a descriptive name.

**Extra Credit**: Create content across 2 pages on your website. You can use the example content from [Lab 12](https://github.com/ksiegmund/PM566-lab12-example) as an example.
