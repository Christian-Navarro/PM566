<p>It looks like the elevation variable has observations with 9999.0, which is probably an indicator for missing. We should take a deeper look at the data dictionary to confirm. The wind speed variable is ok but there are a lot of missing data.</p>
<p>After checking the data we should make the appropriate modifications. Replace elevations with 9999 as <code>NA</code>.</p>

<p>At what elevation is the highest weather station?</p>
<ul>
<li>The weather station with highest elevation is 4113 meters. This is after replacing 9999.0 values with the appropriate code for “missing”, which is “NA”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have the issue of the minimum temperature being -40C, so we should remove those observations.</p>

<h3>6. Calculate summary statistics</h3>
<p>Remember to keep the initial question in mind. We want to pick out the weather station with maximum elevation and examine its windspeed and temperature.</p>
<p>Some ideas: select the weather station with maximum elevation; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed with hour and day of the month.</p>

One thing we should consider for later analyses is to log transform wind speed and elevation as the are very skewed.</p>
<p>Look at where the weather station with highest elevation is located.</p>
