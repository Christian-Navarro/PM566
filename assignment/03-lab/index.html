<p>It looks like the elevation variable has observations with 9999.0, which is probably an indicator for missing. We should take a deeper look at the 
<a href="https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/blob/master/02_met/met-datadictionary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data dictionary</a> to confirm. The wind speed variable is OK but there is a lot of missing data.</p>
<p>After checking the data we should make the appropriate modifications. Replace elevations with 9999 as <code>NA</code>.</p>

<p>There are still some suspiciously low values for temperature (-17.2C), but we will deal with those later.</p>
<p>We should also check the wind speed variable for any abnormalities.</p>

<p>We should check the suspicious temperature value (where is it located?) and validate that the range of elevations make sense (-13m to 4113m).</p>

<p>Remember to keep the initial question in mind. We want to pick out the weather station with maximum elevation and examine its wind speed and temperature.</p>
<p>Some ideas: select the weather station with maximum elevation; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed with hour and day of the month.</p>

<p>Note that to find the maximum elevation, we had to add <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>, because the elevation variable contains missing values. This is an example of how missing values can quickly propagate throughout an analysis (as the “maximum” of <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>NA</code> is <code>NA</code>, because it cannot be defined).</p>
<p>Also note that we used the <code>which</code> function to tell us which elements of the logical comparison are <code>TRUE</code>. We did this because some of them were <code>NA</code>, which can lead to issues when subsetting by a logical variable.</p>

<h1 id="8-ask-questions">8. Ask questions</h1>
<p>By now, you might have some specific questions about how the data was gathered and what some of the different variables and values mean. Alternatively, maybe you have an idea for how some of the variable should be related and you want to explore that relationship. In a real-world analysis, these questions could potentially be answered by a collaborator, who may have been part of the team that collected the data.</p>
<h3 id="what-questions-do-you-have-about-the-data">What questions do you have about the data?</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already, now would be a good time to look at the accompanying 
<a href="https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/blob/master/02_met/met-datadictionary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data dictionary</a> for this dataset and see if it can answer any of your questions. If you have questions about the nature of the dataset and how it was gathered, this might be able to help.</p>
<h3 id="for-questions-about-variables-in-the-dataset-or-relationships-between-them-try-making-some-more-exploratory-plots-do-you-see-the-patterns-you-would-expect">For questions about variables in the dataset or relationships between them, try making some more exploratory plots. Do you see the patterns you would expect?</h3>
<p>There are many different types of summaries and visualization strategies that we have not discussed, but which could provide interesting perspectives on the data.</p>
<p>Some other useful plotting functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pairs</code> for making all pairwise scatter plots in a dataset with &gt;2 dimensions.</li>
<li><code>heatmap</code> and/or <code>corrplot</code> (from the <code>corrplot</code> package) for visualizing matrices in general or correlation matrices in particular.</li>
<li><code>image</code> a low-level matrix visualization function</li>
<li><code>barplot</code>, especially with <code>table</code>, for visualizing frequencies of categorical variables.</li>
